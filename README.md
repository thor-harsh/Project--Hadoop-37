# Project--Hadoop-37

**In this project We will use MapReduce with Python to do an amazing stuff.Here we will find the Most Popular Superhero.** <br></br>
We will find the total no. of characters associated with each superhero which is based on total no. of characters that comes together with each superhero in a comic book.<br></br>

**Before jumping to the code lets understand MapReduce First**...<br></br>

**What is MapReduce?** <br></br>

MapReduce is a programming paradigm that enables massive scalability across hundreds or thousands of servers in a Hadoop cluster. As the processing component, MapReduce is the heart of Apache Hadoop. The term "MapReduce" refers to two separate and distinct tasks that Hadoop programs perform.
A MapReduce program is composed of a map procedure, which performs filtering and sorting, and a reduce method, which performs a summary operation.

**What is Recommender Systems**?<br></br>

Recommender systems are an important class of machine learning algorithms that offer “relevant” suggestions to users. Youtube, Amazon, Netflix, all function on recommendation systems where the system recommends you the next video or product based on your past activity (Content-based Filtering) or based on activities and preferences of other users similar to you (Collaborative Filtering). Likewise, Facebook also uses a recommendation system to suggest Facebook users you may know offline.


**Important Note: Go through the u.data and u.item files before jumping to the code.**

**So what are you waiting for...? Jump to the code to get started. As usual for any doubt or query see you in pull request section 😁😂. Thanks!**
